    - Each looks for a properties file (e.g. atomic.properties, cosmotron.properties)
    - Loads properties file if it's there.
    - Uses hard-coded defaults if not there.
    - Also can override properties using java's -D switches.
    - But, provide a command-line parameter so you can specify the properties file.
