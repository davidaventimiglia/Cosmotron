* To do list for Cosmotron
*** TODO Figure out how to use InputStreams/OutputStreams with HttpClient.
*** TODO Static resources should be served from a configurable location, not the CWD.
*** TODO Figure out how to insert an XSL stylesheet link into service and feed documents
*** TODO Switch to using Tomcat rather than using Jetty
*** TODO Add the joptparser stuff from Atomic
*** TODO Abstract out the Main class stuff for Cosmotron and Atomic into a separate project
*** TODO Abstract out the build stuff into a separate project that generates configure.ac, Makefile.am, and all the rest
    - [ ] configure.ac
    - [ ] Makefile.am
    - [ ] creates lib, doc, src directories
    - [ ] copies in missing files (COPYING, etc.)
    - [ ] touches README, NEWS, AUTHORS, ChangeLog, etc.

*** TODO Prune obsolete heads from Bitbucket and do the same in Atomic.
*** TODO Now that I figured out how to do XSLT (In Atomic, though I'm not using that anymore), put that into Cosmotron.
*** TODO Use the reflective features to be added to Atomic in order to figure out how to generate a form dynamically.
*** TODO Should be able to add new rows to a table.
*** TODO And delete existing rows.
* Development Environment notes
*** Needs autoconf-archive installed
*** After installing autoconf-archive, may need to do autoreconf
*** Doesn't compile with gcj, only with a javac compatible compiler.
